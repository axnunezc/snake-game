# snake-game
This program emulates the classic Snake game, where the user must maneuver their snake around the map in order to "eat" food and grow larger. If the snake's head runs into the walls or its own body, however, the game ends. The game stores the user's high score and displays it on the screen. This project was built using the Turtle module from Python.
